            <p id="aboutmep">My passion for art and other creative outlets has been with me for as long as I can remember. I have been drawing and doodling in all of my notebooks since I was a kid and when it was time to start choosing further edication I already knew it had to be something I would enjoy, somewhere I could still be creative. That's why I chose graphic design, it might not have been the most obvious choice, but it was one that stuck out and made me feel content with going to school again for a bit.</p>
